## Setup

To run the script dynamically on your own machine, first ensure that R and RStudio are downloaded and installed on your machine. Then download the full directory and open the .Rmd file in RStudio and follow the directions provided there.
To view a static output of the .Rmd file, download and open the .pdf, which will include all of the same code and visualizations as the .Rmd file, but will not run dynamically or require the installation of R or RStudio.
